# Framer workshop 
This workshop is intended for the Mobile Design module at Hyper Island.

## Getting started
1. Download [Framer Studio Free Trial](http://framerjs.com/)
2. Download [Sketch Free Trial](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/).

## Three levels of difficulty
You’ll decide by yourself how challenging this workshop will be. However, I only recommend the easiest one if you’ve failed the other ones.

#### +++ Flying Spaghetti Monster level
* Look at the **expected results gif** and create the same result with Framer + Sketch by yourself. (tips, make print screens of the HI site, only recreate everything in Sketch as a bonus)

#### ++ Unicorn level
* Use the [pre-made Sketch file](https://github.com/javve/framerjs-workshop/raw/master/sketch-example.sketch) and then create a show-menu-animation in Framer.

#### + Cat level
* Play around with the [pre-made Sketch file](https://github.com/javve/framerjs-workshop/raw/master/sketch-example.sketch) and the already created [Framer-project](http://framer.link/cl.ly/081p013n333s/download/solution.framer.zip). 

#### Bonus:
Once you’ve completed the challenge feel free to try out some of these bonus challenges:
* Make the active menu blue.
* Make the animation bouncier.
* Recreate the HI mobile site instead of using print screens.
* Use your own imagination!
