### Three levels of difficulty
You’ll decide by yourself how challenging this workshop will be. If you feel like staring with the easier levels, feel free to try out the harder ones afterwards.

#### Flying Spaghetti Monster level (+++)
* Look at the **expected results gif** and create the same result with Framer + Sketch by yourself
#### Unicorn level (++)
* Use the [pre-made Sketch file]() and then create a show-menu-animation in Framer.
#### Cat level (+)
* Play around with the [pre-made Sketch file]() and the already created [Framer-project](). 

#### Bonus:
Once you’ve completed the challenge feel free to try out some of these bonus challenges:
